#Data visualizations that tell the story of the skill gap in Chile.

As part of a Fulbright-sponsored research project, I analyzed publicly available data to quantify the skill gap in Chile. 

These data visualizations help tell the story here. In the Chilean job market, programmers are in high demand. However, the country's education system isn't supplying enough technical talent to meet the needs of the labor market. 

These findings inspired my initiaitve to create project-based curriculum that teaches computer programming in low-resource public schools.
